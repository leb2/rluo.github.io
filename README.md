# jekyll-modern-business

This repo combines [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the [Modern Business](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/modern-business/ "Modern Business") template framework from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/ "Start Bootstrap").


##Prior work

Prior work used to create this repo.

* The starting point is a vanilla [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) installation using a `jekyll new` command.
* Next the [Modern Business](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/modern-business/ "Modern Business") template framework is applied.
* HTML markup in the template is then refactored into `_layouts` and `_includes`.
* The template is further refactored with several snippets from the [Jekyll-Snippets](https://github.com/mdo/jekyll-snippets) project.
